# protected-admix
Admix for applications whose software source is protected by license
Source tarballs are held on UCI's CRSP server in the rcic-admin lab 
under the share/Software Sources/protected-admix

Simplest way forward when building is to sftp the entire protected-admix directory to the sources directory.
